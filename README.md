## About Our Project

PhinesChen is a project that transformed the website for our local food bank, [Merced County Food Bank](https://mmcfb.org/) (MCFB). We focused on tackling three main issues to help ease the lives of the food bank. First we created a brand new site with updated information about the bank, a map to help locate food distribution sites to anyone on the website and a login system for the Admins or simple users. The first main issue we tackled was digitizing the storage system, MCFB did everything by hand from processing requests to managing inventory. We created a back-end database to store any number of items MCFB may receive and added a front-end component for easily inputting data. Then we built a tracker to stay informed on when a shipment will reach the food bank or reach a distribution site. Lastly we created a Admin UI so all data related to MCFB can be tracked including amount of food, money donated/spent, requests/donation forms, and much more. All of these changes were done on one web platform with very intuitive designs so anyone would be able to operate it.
