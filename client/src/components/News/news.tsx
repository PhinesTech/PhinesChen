                Health and food bank officials in Merced County are teaming up on a 
                project to make fresh produce more accessible to food pantries and 
                low-income households. 

                The Merced County Food Bank and the Merced County  Public Health Department 
                are launching the Glean Grow Give project this summer.

                Local food pantries are seeing increased demand this holiday season,
                despite a spike in year-end charitable giving. 

                Since 2014, the Merced County Food Bank has also served as an official distribution 
                site for the stateâ€™s drought-relief food box program, handing out an average of 12,000 
                boxes every month to those in need.
