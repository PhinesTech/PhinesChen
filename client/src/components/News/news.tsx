                Health and food bank officials in Merced County are teaming up on a 
                <br/>project to make fresh produce more accessible to food pantries and 
                low-<br/>income  households. 

                The Merced County Food Bank and the Merced County <br/> Public Health Department 
                are launching the Glean Grow Give project this summer <br/> as a way to add 
                healthier food to diets, said Bill Gibbs, executive director <br/>of the food bank.

                Local food pantries are seeing increased demand this holiday season, <br/>
                despite a spike in year-end charitable giving. 

                Since 2014, the Merced County Food Bank <br/> has also served as an official distribution 
                site for the stateâ€™s drought-relief food box <br/> program, handing out an average of 12,000 
                boxes every month to those in need.
