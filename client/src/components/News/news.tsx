                        Health and food bank officials in Merced County are teaming up on a project to make fresh
                        produce more accessible to food pantries and low-income households. The Merced County Food Bank
                        and the Merced County Public Health Department are launching the Glean Grow Give project this
                        summer.

                        charitable giving. Since 2014, the Merced County Food Bank has also served as an official
                        distribution site for the stateâ€™s drought-relief food box program, handing out an average of
                        12,000 boxes every month to those in need.

                        is given out twice a month in 16 cities throughout Merced County and one site in Mariposa
